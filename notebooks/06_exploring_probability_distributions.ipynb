    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a probability distribution?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A probability distribution is a mathematical function that describes the likelihood of different possible outcomes for an experiment or a random variable. In data science and statistics, it's the cornerstone of modelling because it provides a theoretical framework for understanding the structure of our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Goal & The Role of Distributions**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to model the demand for medical procedures (MRI, CT, Endoscopy) across different geographical areas and demographic groups, specifically using ONS 5-year age bands. Understanding the underlying probability distribution of our data is crucial for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Model Selection:** The nature of our target variable (e.g., is it a count, a proportion, or a continuous measurement?) dictates the type of statistical model we should use. Choosing a model that matches our data's distribution (e.g., Poisson Regression for counts) leads to more accurate and reliable results.\n",
    "2.  **Inference & Simulation:** A well-fitted distribution allows us to make statistical inferences. We can estimate the average demand, quantify our uncertainty with confidence intervals, and simulate future scenarios (e.g., \"What happens if the population in an area increases by 10%?\").\n",
    "3.  **Feature Engineering:** Understanding distributions helps us decide when and how to transform our data to meet the assumptions of certain machine learning algorithms."

    "Count data involves non-negative integers (0, 1, 2, ...). In our project, the absolute number of procedures performed for an age group is count data. These discrete distributions are the natural candidates for modelling it."

    "### The Poisson Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The Poisson distribution is the classic choice for modelling the number of times an event occurs within a fixed interval of time or space, given we know the average rate of occurrence and each event is independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Properties:**\n",
    "- **Parameter:** The rate parameter, $\\lambda$ (lambda), which is the mean number of events in the interval.\n",
    "- **Mean:** $E[X] = \\lambda$\n",
    "- **Variance:** $Var(X) = \\lambda$\n",
    "- **Probability Mass Function (PMF):** The probability of observing exactly $k$ events is given by:\n",
    "$$ P(X=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "**Application to Health Demand:**\n",
    "- **Direct Link:** This is a natural first choice for modelling the **number of CT scans** required by a specific age group (e.g., 50-54 year olds) in a particular geographic area (e.g., an LSOA) over a fixed time period (e.g., one month).\n",
    "- **Parameter Interpretation:** In this context, $\\lambda$ would represent the average number of CT scans we'd expect for that demographic group in that area and time.\n",
    "- **Spatial ML Relevance:** In a spatial model, we could aim to predict a unique $\\lambda$ for each LSOA based on its demographic makeup, deprivation index, and proximity to a hospital. A key limitation is its assumption that the mean equals the variance. If the variance in the data is much larger than the mean (a common situation called 'overdispersion'), the Poisson model may not be the best fit."

    "- **Relationship to Poisson:** When $n$ is very large and $p$ is very small, the Binomial distribution can be approximated by a Poisson distribution where $\\lambda = np$. Given the large population sizes and relatively small procedure rates, this connection is highly relevant to our dataset."

    "- **Direct Link:** This is perfect for modelling waiting times. For example, if a hospital's endoscopy unit receives patients at an average rate of $\\lambda=2$ patients per hour, the Exponential distribution could model the time between patient arrivals. It's also widely used in survival analysis to model the time until an event occurs, like equipment failure or disease remission."

    "\n",
    "**Application to Health Demand:**\n",
    "- **Direct Link:** While raw procedure *counts* are unlikely to be normally distributed, the *rates* might be, or they can often be transformed to become approximately normal (e.g., using a log transform). More commonly, the Normal distribution is used to model the *errors* (residuals) of a regression model. Many standard statistical models (like Linear Regression) formally assume that these errors are normally distributed."

The `Endoscopy (procedure) rate / 1,000` from our data, once divided by 1,000 to become a true proportion (a value between 0 and 1), could be modelled with a Beta distribution.\n",
    "- **Parameter Interpretation:** The $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ parameters (the 'shape' parameters) would allow us to model our belief about this proportion. For example, a high $\\alpha$ and low $\\beta$ would mean we believe the proportion is likely to be high."
